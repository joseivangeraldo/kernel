 To create this directory, execute the following command, as user root, before starting the download session:

mkdir -v $LFS/sources

Make this directory writable and sticky. “Sticky” means that even if multiple users have write permission on a directory, only the owner of a file can delete the file within a sticky directory. The following command will enable the write and sticky modes:

chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources

There are several ways to obtain all the necessary packages and patches to build LFS:

    The files can be downloaded individually as described in the next two sections.

    For stable versions of the book, a tarball of all the needed files can be downloaded from one of the mirror sites listed at https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html#files.

    The files can be downloaded using wget and a wget-list as described below.

To download all of the packages and patches by using wget-list-systemd as an input to the wget command, use:

wget --input-file=wget-list-systemd --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources
